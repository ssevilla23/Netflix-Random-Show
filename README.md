# üçøRandom Netflix Show Generator
The Random Netflix Show Generator is a website that contains a
curated list of fifteen Netflix shows. Users can choose a genre
from a dropdown menu, and the website will display a random show based on their choice.

For this academic project, I was responsible for developing the JavaScript
code for the random show generator. Users can select a genre from four options:
Comedy, Fantasy, Drama or Random. When they choose a specific genre, a random show
from that genre will be displayed. If the ‚ÄúRandom‚Äù option is chosen, a show from
any genre will be shown.
